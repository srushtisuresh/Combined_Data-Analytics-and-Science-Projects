# Data-Analytics-and-Science-Projects

I have built different projects over the course of my school time. The projects reflect the diversity of skills I have learned over the 6 years of my
education and multiple internship opportunities. I believe each of the projects highlight a unique perpective and a methodical problem solving approach.
Although in internships I have dealt with much larger and more complex datasets, I believe that I have put in what is required in an organized manner for
each available public dataset. 

1. ** Apple Watch Analysis Project ** - The summary and conclusion are mentioned in the project jupyter notebook (took advantage of the markdown files). I 
use apple watch 24/7 and everytime I took a walk or exercised, the watch predicted the type of activity I might be doing. This encouraged me to go further
into the dataset and explore how an apple watch work behind the screens. 

2. ** Global Cost of Living ** - Being a data enthusiast, I am a member of multiple data groups on linkedin. I have come across various visualizations
on the same dataset and have been caught by surprise everytime I look at the conclusions. I believe the difference in the conclusion coming from the same
dataset that everyone is using is from the level of data cleaning. I went ahead and tried to clean the data myself and concluded on how accurate these
visualizations are based on facts and numbers.

3. ** Marketing A/B Testing ** - I have conducted A/B Testing multiple times and wanted to do a small project highlighting the basics. While there is so
much more to it, I wanted to bring out my "result-oriented" mindset by conducting the analysis on what's exactly required with the given data. Instead of
playing around and exploring it in and out, I felt that the exploratory skills had already been showcased in other projects and kills the purpose of
why I wanted to build this particular one.

4. ** Sentiment_Analysis ** - Pandemic had augmented angst among Indian SubContinent about the chinese products. The tweets were raging in on the
platform and coming to a conclusion with different opinions was only becoming difficult. During this time, "make in india" movement was super popular
as well. Thus, I wanted to analyze the sentiments of the people related to boycotting chinese market products and research on how it effected the 
Indian Market in return. The idea behind the project was not only to develop a model to analyze the twitter sentiments but also to learn to implement 
different ML Algorithms and differentiate between their performance metrices.

5. ** Tableau Dashboard ** - The purpose behind this project was to highlight the data visualization skills. I love to play with data and explore the 
unexplored. There is so much information on student alcohol consumption that it became really challenging to showcase the important information. Thus,
I created an interactive dashboard where the user himself can control the amount of alcohol consumption to understand different aspects of a student's life.
For example, when the alcohol consumption filter is brought to '2-4' (low) more students do well in school overall as compared to '8-10' (high). The 
dashboard tries to bring out all the important factors affecting alcohol consumption in a student's life.
